			The floor plans are identical for different floors within the same building.
			To identify offices, keep in mind that the first digit identifies the building 
			(three digit numbers are in Cannon, four digit numbers starting with 1 are in Longworth, 
			and four digit numbers starting with 2 are in Rayburn), the next number indicates building floor, 
			and the last two numbers indicate specific office. For example, Room 2255 is on the second floor of Rayburn.</p>
