			To identify offices, keep in mind that the first digit identifies the building 
			(three digit numbers are in Cannon, four digit numbers starting with 1 are in Longworth, 
			and four digit numbers starting with 2 are in Rayburn), the next number indicates building floor, 
			and the last two numbers indicate specific office. For example, Room 2255 is on the second floor of Rayburn.</p>
